# Predictive research — 2026-10-10

Objective remains unmet: at least 90% profitable ACTIVE days, net profit after
costs, unchanged budgets/loss limits, and independent forward evidence.
No-trade days are not wins. No model here is authorized to submit broker orders.

## New exploratory experiments

`predictive_portfolio_research.py` compares logistic and boosted classifiers on
20 fixed present-day stocks, two decision times and four exit rules. Historical
results are in ignored `research_runs/predictive_portfolio/results.json` and
`research_runs/predictive_portfolio_conditioned/results.json`. The latter fits
and calibrates only on simulated filled historical orders; prediction and
selection do not prefilter future test candidates by their eventual fills.
No variant passed the research target screen. Tiny samples with apparent 100%
success do not qualify. These dates were previously explored, not untouched.

`quantum_kernel_research.py` compares an RBF kernel and a four-qubit simulated
fidelity kernel using identical training-only scaler/PCA, fixed C=1, fixed
thresholds, expanding training, 60 calibration dates and 20-date test blocks.
Each fit uses a deterministic maximum of 600 past training and calibration
rows. Two encoding layers use H, RZ and ring CZ gates. This is a CPU statevector
simulation, not quantum hardware, computational advantage, or market physics.

Data: cached SIP minute bars, 20 stocks, 176 exploratory test sessions, 9 folds.
All scenarios use the existing research portfolio simulator: cash-only, at
most three positions, 1% account per stock, 5% category cap, 1% price stops,
conservative gap handling, whole shares, signal-frozen entry limits, and no
overnight exposure. Primary cost is 10 bps per side; 20 bps and an extra minute
of entry latency are separately reported stress cases. Full raw results:
`research_runs/quantum_kernel/results.json` (ignored, local artifact).

### Primary outcomes: profit target +0.4%, exit within 60 minutes

| Kernel | Probability threshold | Active days | Winning active days | Net USD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Classical RBF | 0.50 | 148 | 54.05% | -476.02 |
| Quantum fidelity | 0.50 | 148 | 47.97% | -600.94 |
| Classical RBF | 0.65 | 70 | 55.71% | -198.80 |
| Quantum fidelity | 0.65 | 67 | 49.25% | -254.45 |

Thresholds 0.80 and 0.90 produced no active days, not successful forecasts.
Without the profit target, at threshold 0.50 the RBF model traded four losing
days (-28.94 USD), and fidelity one losing day (-11.83 USD). All 48
kernel/horizon/threshold/cost/latency outcomes failed the screen. This rejects
these particular models, not all quantum or classical learning approaches.

## Limits and next evidence

- Current stock membership creates selection/survivorship bias.
- Bar fills, stops and account guards are approximate, not a tick-level replay
  of the entire production account. Small experimental allocation does not
  prove behavior of a fully allocated account. End-of-day peak reference is
  not a full intraday high-water mark. All entries occur at one fixed time;
  there are no later entries for an intraday entry cutoff to block.
- Costs are assumed, not calibrated from a representative historical quote
  sample. A preliminary paginated AAPL request returned only the first 10,000
  quotes: median full spread about 1.52 bps. It was truncated and is NOT enough
  to lower cost assumptions or represent other symbols, times or market impact.
- Next: measure representative bid/ask coverage and execution assumptions,
  then research features/regime selection. Log all additional trials. Reusing
  these historical dates cannot become independent evidence through renaming.
- Independent forward evidence is absent. Earliest proposed start October 12
  is a proposal, not proof that collection is running or a model is deployed.

Verification: 212 local tests passed, including normalization/PSD of the
fidelity kernel, invariance of existing predictions to changes in future
candidate rows, chronological date separation, conservative stop/target
ordering and portfolio caps. These verify implementation, not profitability.
